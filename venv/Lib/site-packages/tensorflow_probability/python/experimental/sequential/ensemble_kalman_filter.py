  The [Ensemble Kalman Filter](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Kalman_filter) is a Monte Carlo
  version of the traditional Kalman Filter.

  This method is the 'prediction' equation associated with the Ensemble
  Kalman Filter. This takes in an optional `inflate_fn` to perform covariance
  inflation on the ensemble [2].

  Args:
    state: Instance of `EnsembleKalmanFilterState`.
    transition_fn: callable returning a (joint) distribution over the next
      latent state, and any information in the `extra` state.
      Each component should be an instance of
      `MultivariateNormalLinearOperator`.
    seed: PRNG seed; see `tfp.random.sanitize_seed` for details.
    inflate_fn: Function that takes in the `particles` and returns a
      new set of `particles`. Used for inflating the covariance of points.
      Note this function should try to preserve the sample mean of the
      particles, and scale up the sample covariance.
    name: Python `str` name for ops created by this method.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., `'ensemble_kalman_filter_predict'`).
  Returns:
    next_state: `EnsembleKalmanFilterState` representing particles after
      applying `transition_fn`.
